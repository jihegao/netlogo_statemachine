# WHAT IS IT?

An alternative implementation of the NetLogo model 'State Machine Example'. Use an external JSON file to define the bugs' statechart, and imported into a turtles-own statechart (a netlogo table or dictionary). 

# HOW IT WORKS

A state machine consists of state names, state behaviors, and transitions between states. We use key "name" to refer state name, key "action" to refer behaviors, and key "transfer_conditions" to refer transition rules.
